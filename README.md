Detailed Steps

	1.	Development Environment:
	•	Ensure the .devcontainer configuration specifies the correct Python version and dependencies.
	2.	Google Sheets & Forms:
	•	Link the Google Form to the appropriate Google Sheet.
	•	Create an override sheet for manual score entries and corrections.
	3.	Google Apps Script:
	•	Write and deploy a script to process scores and apply overrides.
	•	Set up triggers to automate running the script on form submission.
	4.	Python Script:
	•	Develop and test the script to process data and output JSON files.
	•	Ensure the script correctly reads credentials from environment variables.
	5.	GitHub Repository:
	•	Initialize the repository and commit the project files.
	•	Use .gitignore to exclude sensitive and unnecessary files from the repository.
	6.	GitHub Actions Workflow:
	•	Create a workflow configuration file to automate running the Python script and committing updated JSON files.
	•	Set up environment variables for credentials in GitHub Secrets.
	7.	GitHub Pages:
	•	Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
	•	Ensure the index.html and JSON files are in the correct directory for GitHub Pages to serve them.

Summary

By following these steps, you can set up a robust system for collecting, processing, and displaying disc golf scores. Players can submit their scores via a form, the data will be processed automatically with Python, and the results will be displayed on a web page hosted on GitHub Pages. Automation through GitHub Actions ensures that the data is always up-to-date without manual intervention.
